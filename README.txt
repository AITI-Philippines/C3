C3: Course Curriculum Checklist

    This project is an application made for students of the University of the Philippines Diliman. The application tracks the subjects that a student has already taken. This information will be used to display the student's academic standing and possibly give suggestions on which sujbects to take for the next semesters. Handy functionalities, like a Grade Weighted Average computer, will also be included to help each student.
