## About Check-UP ##

**Check-UP: Course Curriculum Checklist**

This project is an application made _by_ and _for_ students of the [University of the Philippines Diliman](http://upd.edu.ph/). The application requires the user's registration *year* and course. It then uses the corresponding curriculum to track the subjects that a student has already taken and has yet to take. It will also display the student's academic standing and give suggestions on which sujbects to take for the next semesters. Statistics such as General Weighted Average (GWA), units left, years left, P.E.'s left, and more will help the student succeed in school.
